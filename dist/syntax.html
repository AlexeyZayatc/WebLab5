          <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>

            <p>If style sheets could only apply a declaration to each element of a Web page, they would be pretty useless. The real goal is to apply different declarations to different parts of the document. </p>
            <p>CSS allows this by associating conditions with declarations blocks. Each (valid) declaration block is preceded by a selector which is a condition selecting some elements of the page. The pair selector-declarations block is called a ruleset, or often simply a rule.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-block"> 
            <p>As an element of the page may be matched by several selectors, and therefore by several rules eventually containing a given property several times, with different values, the CSS standard defines which one has precedence over the other and must be applied: this is called the cascade algorithm.</p>
